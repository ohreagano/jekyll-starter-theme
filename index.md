What's Markdown (`.md`)?

Markdown is markup that lets you write hypertext (HTML) documents
in easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text.
No angle brackets `<></>` required for
paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, tables, etc.

Just getting started with Markdown?
See [The Markdown Reference Book][writekit] for a
HTML <-> Markdown Quick Reference (Cheat Sheet).
Or for more detailed syntax references, check out [John Gruber's guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) -- he created markdown
