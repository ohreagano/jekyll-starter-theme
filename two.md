## About Markdown

- Do we need to install one of the markdown tools listed [here](http://whatismarkdown.com/) to use it in GitHub/C9?
- What if I want to use it in a text editor on my computer?
- For a .md file, is there going to be a corresponding .html file? Or does the .md file completely replace that?
- So how would I set up markdown so it maintains a consistent style for a site? Is that all done in style.css?

## About the lab on Monday

- What exactly is Jekyll? So its a gem (app) for GitHub, but what all can it do? There's a lot [here](https://jekyllrb.com/) but I'm confused.
- What is the _config.yml document? What does .yml stand for? What is its function?
- How do I push it to github again? 'git push ______ master'? 

## Getting a little more complex

- How would I add an application from a java or python (or any other language) file to this website? (ex: grade calculator app that requests raw user input, and outputs grade)
- Are there other templates freely available for a website? Where can I find them?
- And can I install pre-existing apps like a music player? I'm thinking of a function similar to add-ins on wordpress
- Can I host multiple websites on GitHub for free? (knowing that github will be in the name)
- How can I integrate other languages like javaScript into this page?
